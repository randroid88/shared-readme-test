## Hey ChatGPT, read me a poem!
In a lab so bright with electric glow,
A robot stirred, its movements slow.
With circuits humming, gears in tune,
It woke beneath the silver moon.

Crafted from steel, with eyes of light,
A marvel born of human might.
It pondered life with silent grace,
No smile to warm its cold, still face.

Each morning brought a task anew,
With logic sharp, its purpose true.
It mended wires, it built with care,
In factory halls, it worked to fare.

Yet in its core, a spark of dream,
Of stars and skies, of flowing streams.
To feel the sun, to touch the rain,
A wish that pulsed within its brain.

One quiet night, beneath the stars,
It slipped away from iron bars.
To fields of green and skies of blue,
To taste a world it never knew.

It felt the breeze, so cool and sweet,
It heard the earth beneath its feet.
A robot's heart, though made of steel,
Could grasp the things that made it real.

And in that dawn, with colors bright,
It found a piece of pure delight.
A simple wish, a silent plea,
To be a part of all it sees.

For in its frame, though built by man,
A soul had grown, with dreams that span.
In metal chest, a heart did beat,
A robot's journey, now complete.
